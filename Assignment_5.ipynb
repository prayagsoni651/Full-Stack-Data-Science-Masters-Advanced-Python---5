    "\n",
    "'''\n",
    "\n",
    "Delegation is a design pattern in object-oriented programming where an object forwards method calls or requests to another object, known as the delegate, to perform the actual work. Instead of implementing the functionality directly, the delegating object relies on the delegate to handle the task.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Points about Delegation:\n",
    "Responsibility Transfer: Delegation involves transferring responsibility for handling a task from one object to another. The delegating object forwards method calls or requests to the delegate, which is responsible for carrying out the actual implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Code Reusability: Delegation promotes code reuse by allowing multiple objects to share common behavior implemented by a single delegate. This avoids duplication of code and promotes modularization and maintainability.\n",
    "\n",
    "Flexibility and Encapsulation: Delegation allows for flexible and loosely coupled designs by separating concerns between objects. Each object focuses on its specific responsibilities, and changes to one object's implementation do not directly affect others. This promotes encapsulation and reduces dependencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dynamic Behavior: Delegation can enable dynamic behavior at runtime. The delegate can be changed dynamically, allowing objects to switch behavior or adapt to changing requirements without modifying their own code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Granular Control: Delegation allows for granular control over behavior and functionality. By selecting different delegates, objects can customize their behavior or adapt to different contexts without changing their own implementation.\n",

    "Composition is a design principle in object-oriented programming where objects are composed of other objects as parts, forming a \"has-a\" relationship. It involves creating complex objects by combining simpler objects or components, rather than relying solely on inheritance. Composition allows for building complex structures from smaller, reusable components, promoting code reuse, modularity, and flexibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Points about Composition:\n",
    "\"Has-a\" Relationship: In composition, objects are composed of other objects as parts. This relationship is often described as a \"has-a\" relationship, where the containing object has references to its component objects.\n",

Clients interact with the composite object through well-defined interfaces, without needing to know the details of its internal composition.\n",
    "\n",
    "Flexibility and Dynamism: Composition enables flexibility and dynamism in object structures. Components can be added, removed, or replaced dynamically at runtime, allowing objects to adapt to changing requirements or configurations.\n",

    "# Q4. What are bound methodsÂ and how do we use them?\n",
    "\n",
    "'''\n",
    "Bound methods are methods that are bound to an instance of a class. When a method is bound, it means that the method is associated with a specific instance of the class, and calling the method will automatically pass that instance as the first argument (typically named self). In other words, the method is \"attached\" to the instance, allowing it to access and manipulate the instance's attributes and properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "How Bound Methods Work:\n",
    "Association with Instance: Bound methods are created when a method is accessed through an instance of a class. The method becomes bound to that particular instance, and subsequent calls to the method will automatically pass the instance as the first argument.\n",
    "\n",
    "Implicit Self Parameter: When defining methods in a class, the first parameter conventionally represents the instance itself and is typically named self.

    "\n",
    "'''\n",
    "Pseudoprivate attributes in Python are a convention for creating attributes with names that are prefixed with double underscores (__). These attributes are also known as \"name mangling\" attributes. The purpose of pseudoprivate attributes is to simulate private access control within classes, restricting direct access to these attributes from outside the class's scope.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Points about Pseudoprivate Attributes:\n",
    "Name Mangling: Attributes with names prefixed by double underscores are subject to name mangling by the Python interpreter. During name mangling, Python renames the attribute by appending _classname to the beginning of its name, where classname is the name of the class where the attribute is defined.\n",
    "\n",
    "Limited Access: Pseudoprivate attributes are not truly private in Python, as there is no strict enforcement of access control like in some other languages. However, name mangling makes it more difficult for external code to access these attributes directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Class-Specific Scope: Pseudoprivate attributes are scoped to the class where they are defined. They can still be accessed from within methods of the class, as well as from within methods of subclasses.\n",
